SimpleOres2
==========

Repository for SimpleOres2

Created by AleXndrTheGr8st, maintained by Sinhika, 1.15.2 port by Paint_Ninja.
Back-ported to 1.14.4 by Sinhika.

Forge 1.15.2 port enabled thanks to Cadiboo's LGPL-licensed example code 
<https://github.com/Cadiboo/Example-Mod> that he made free to all to borrow, 
in the hopes of encouraging good coding practices in
Forge mods. I hope I did a good job with it. 

Thanks also to Paint_Ninja for doing the initial 1.15.2 port, which encourages
me to get back to tackling all the messy issues involved in porting these
mods up from 1.12.2

**WARNING: 1.15/1.14 is a Work-in-Progress; expect frequent changes!**

TO-DO
-----
* fix copper buckets vis-a-vis fluids. When I make sense out of fluid containers.
* make recipes disable-able in config.
* Implement graphical configuration from the menu...when Forge re-implents it.
* update or move the SimpleOres, etc. wiki
